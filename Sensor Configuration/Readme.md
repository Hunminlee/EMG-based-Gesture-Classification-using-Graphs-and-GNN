## Sensor Configuration


This page serves to illustrate the quantitative significance of participant electrodes and their configuration setups within the context of upper-limb gesture recognition. Through a series of meticulously conducted experiments involving the selective exclusion or inclusion of specific electrodes, we provide empirical evidence that our Graph Neural Network (GNN) model sustains substantial performance levels even in scenarios where a considerable number of electrodes have been omitted.

Of particular note is the discernible preservation of performance metrics, underscoring the intrinsic importance of relational features encapsulated within the dataset. These features, deemed both deterministic and discriminable, play a pivotal role in facilitating accurate upper-limb gesture recognition within the framework of our GNN model.

By elucidating the resilience of our model to variations in electrode configurations, this empirical analysis reinforces the pivotal role of relational features in enhancing the efficacy of gesture recognition systems, thereby contributing to advancements in the field of human-computer interaction.
