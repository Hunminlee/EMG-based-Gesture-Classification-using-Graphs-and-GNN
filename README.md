# EMG-based-Gesture-Classification-using-Graphs-and-GNN

The project introduces a novel approach to EMG-based upper-limb gesture recognition systems, leveraging advancements in deep learning and graph neural networks. Traditional methodologies often fail to capture relational information within multi-channel EMG sensor networks, limiting model performance, generalizability, and interpretability. To address these challenges, the project presents meticulously crafted graph structures to encapsulate spatial and temporal relationships of EMG sensors and signals. By employing Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based classification models, the project achieves state-of-the-art performance across various gesture recognition tasks while providing interpretable insights into muscular activation patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in maintaining high accuracy even with reduced sensor configurations suggests its potential for integration into AI-powered rehabilitation strategies.
