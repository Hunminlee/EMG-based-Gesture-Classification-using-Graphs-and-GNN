## High-Density surface electromyography - CapgMyo Type B dataset

The CapgMyo Type A and Type B datasets feature 128 high-density sensors and incorporate data from 18 and 20 intact subjects, respectively. These datasets encompass 8 isometric and isotonic gesture action classes, each comprising 10 repetitive trials. Preprocessing of the CapgMyo dataset involved band-pass filtering within the 20â€“380 Hz range, 16-bit A/D conversion, and normalization to the range of -1 ~ 1, corresponding to voltage values of -2.5mV ~ 2.5mV. The gesture class aligns with the first 8 gestures in Ninapro DB5 Exercise B, encompassing Thumb up (1), Extension of index and middle, flexion of the others (2), Flexion of ring and little finger, extension of the others (3), Thumb opposing base of little finger (4), Abduction of all fingers (5), Fingers flexed together in fist (6), Pointing index (7), Abduction of extended fingers (8).
