## BandMyo

The BandMyo dataset includes signals recorded from 8 sensors using a Myo armband. It encompasses 15 distinct hand gestures, categorized into five finger gestures, six wrist gestures, and four other hand motion gestures, with each gesture repeated 8 times. Data collection involved 6 intact subjects, who removed the armband and took inter-repetition breaks, thereby introducing greater signal variance between repetitions.
