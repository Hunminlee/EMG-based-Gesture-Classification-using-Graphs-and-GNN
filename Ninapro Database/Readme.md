## Ninapro Database (DB5)

The objective of the Ninapro project is to facilitate research on advanced hand myoelectric prosthetics by providing publicly available datasets. In our experiment, we utilize Database 5, which encompasses EMG signals captured from 16 synchronized EMG sensors and encompasses 53 distinct hand gesture classes, including a rest class. The gesture taxonomy within DB5 comprises three main categories: basic finger movements (gestures 1-12), hand configurations and wrist movements (gestures 13-30), and grasping and functional movements (gestures 31-52), with detailed descriptions provided in ~\cite{Ninapro}. Data acquisition involved 6 repetitions performed by 10 intact subjects.
