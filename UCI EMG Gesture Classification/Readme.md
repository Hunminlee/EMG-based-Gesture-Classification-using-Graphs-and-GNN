## UCI EMG Pattern Database 

The UCI EMG Pattern Database incorporates data from 36 subjects, employing 8 EMG sensors. This dataset covers 7 specific gesture classes, which are hand at rest (1), hand clenched in a fist (2), wrist flexion (3), wrist extension (4), radial deviations (5), ulnar deviations (6), extended palm(7), each performed for 3 seconds with a 3-second pause between gestures. The extended palm gesture class was excluded from the training phase due to its unavailability for multiple subjects.
